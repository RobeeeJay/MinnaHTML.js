Having been coding since the age of 10, starting with BASIC and then Z80 assembley language on the ZX-81 and ZX Spectrum, Robee has journeyed through the hell of 16-bit DOS and Windows development in C/C++ where pointers regularly wrapped around, through 32-bit Windows, the early days of ASP and finally to the modern joyous world of Node.JS.\r\n\r\nThat's quite a lot of programming experience, with so little to show for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat's It Do?\r\n=============\r\n\r\nMinnaHTML is a very easy to grasp, simple object oriented library for the quick generation of webpages with as little or as much object oriented code as the user desires.\r\n\r\nAs importantly, it is async aware, which means you can use it to pass off a DIV object to a function with a callback, and not worry about delivering an incomplete HTML file to the end client."}
